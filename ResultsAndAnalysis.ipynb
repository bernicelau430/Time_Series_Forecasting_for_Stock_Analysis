    "To conclude, the best classification model to predict stock close prices for NVIDIA stock is Long Short Term Memory. As seen above, Long Short Term Memory had a significantly smaller mean squared error, even distribution of residuals, and low residual values. This is due to a couple reasons...\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Term Short Memory\n",
    "- LSTM is a recurrent neural network is designed to handle sequential data. Thus, it is ideal for time-series forecasting and predicting stock prices. Since this model uses memory cells, it can remember relevant data, even over long periods of time.\n",
    "- Since stock prices are highly sequential, LSTM can easily capture trends such as patterns and fluctuations. Thus, it would make sense that this model performs the best for this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest-Neighbors\n",
    "- KNN is a very simple algorithm that predicts the value of new data points based on the points that are closest to it. It basically calculates the Euclidean distance between target points and looks for the most similar instances.\n",
    "- This model has significant limitations...\n",
    "    1. Static, non generational approach\n",
    "        - KNN does not consider the sequence or ordering of previous points. Due to how the algorithm functions, KNN has no way to capture trends or dependences of previous data points. In trying to predict on time series data, capturing trends is the most important thing.\n",
    "    2. Lagging predictions\n",
    "        - Since KNN essentially pattern matches to make predictions, it is not a great option for predicting stock prices. If the price changes drastically in a short period of time, KNN will often fall behind on its prediction because it cannot predict something out of the ordinary. \n",
    "- These limitations were explicitly depicted in the result of our KNN model. This model predicted a horizonal line for the stock prices. This tells us that KNN was basically just taking the average of the closest neighbors and not capturing any real trends of patterns. It is obvious why this is not ideal for predicting stock close prices, and tells us that this was not the correct machine learning model to use for time series forcasting on Nvidia stock close prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest\n",
    "- RF is a model based on many different decision trees. Each tree is trained on a subset of data which can allow it to capture patterns of the data. However, the final prediction is typically the average of predictions from each tree\n",
    "- This model too has significant limitations...\n",
    "    1. Feature Dependency\n",
    "        - Random Forest is essentially a combination of many different decision trees that allow the machine to predict based on many features what the target will be. Thus, Random Forest depends on many features to make an accurate prediction. That is not what we have here. We are predicting on previous stock prices and trying to capture trends, not multiple features that can influence stock prices. \n",
    "    2. Averaging Effect\n",
    "        - With the many decision trees that are combined to create the random forest, the model must use all the values that come from each tree. Thus, it takes the average of the values. Taking the average often causes the prediction to \"smooth out,\" something that can be seen in the visualization of its prediction. This is a problem because stocks jump up and down, so a horizonal prediction will almost never be correct.\n",
    "- Thus, Random Forest is not a good option for time series forecasting. Since it depends on many different features and uses tree averages to make a prediction, stock price trends are not captured and thus the predicted stock values are not adequate."
